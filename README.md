Assumptions
- Error Handling kept at basic exception level
- Application does not have validation or pre-requisites for account number
- Account number is entered manually in the request body with name, is it not auto generated by the code
- Only small number of unit tests added to demonstrate testing style
- Not accounting for any vulernatbilities e.g. SQL injection, passing account number in url to get balance for example
- Transferring funds does not give new balances that can be checked through the check balance call
- Transferring funds is done by 2 update calls to satisfy HSQLDB, would be changed to 1 update with case method in SQL method
